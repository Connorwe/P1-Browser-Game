<!-- Inpiration for the game: -->

My inspiration for this game is to create a cool theme were a rat has to dodge enemies coming towards him in order to survive.
(Somewhat like the Trex game that pops up when you dont have wifi)

<!-- Controls -->

Use a to move left, d to move right, and w to jump

<!-- Technologies -->

To make this game I used HTML, Javascript, and CSS. I mainly used the canvas element in HTML to develop the game.

<!-- Bugs -->

Game runs at different speeds depending on how many monitors are open. With two monitors open the game runs a lot faster than with only one open.
